## Solution Structure

This repository includes two applications: an Angular SPA in the `angular` folder, and an ASP.NET Core web API app in the `webapi` folder. The SPA makes HTTP requests to the server side (the `webapi` app) using an API BaseURL `https://localhost:44389`. The API BaseURL is set in the `environment.ts` file and the `environment.prod.ts` file, which can be modified based on your situation.

- `angular`
  The SPA application demonstrates JWT authorization in the front-end.
- `webapi`
  The ASP.NET Core web API app is served by Kestrel on Docker. This app has implemented HTTPS support.
